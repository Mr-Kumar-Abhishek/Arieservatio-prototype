###contribution guidelines:

* Well all the servers access you could find it in the wiki of this repo. And please if you are a developer I don't have to point out where you will find the wiki.

* Before commiting to this **upstream** repo please check on any bugs that may had croped up while programming by pushing your commits in the server porvided.

* If you are planning to testing your new feature or commits , you need to give your RSA SSH keys in our chatrooms or by privately mailing the repo owner. On how to make RSA SSH keys and all other information which you should know and don't know it yet will be included in the wiki of this repo soon.

* single branch, we are not following the git work flow for this repo as the server only supports one master branch we will develope in svn work flow. That is only one branch and everyone stamping in each other foots.(YaY !! for all the old fossils who still vouch for svn , okay I will stop being sarcastinc now.)

* learn markdown , if you don't know till yet, it will do good for all of us. And if you are feeling a bit generous then extend our wiki. where to learn markdown ?? I am not telling, you are a developer find it out. Or wait for the wiki to have those pages/links.
